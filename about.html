  I am Zsuzsanna Horvath from Budapest, Hungary. My career started when I moved to Montreal after finishing College. I never thought, that Iâ€™ll be a nail designer until I graduated. It has been always important to me, to work in a creative, inspiring environment and make others happy, build and boost self-confidence by making a fresh mani.
After spending two years in Canada, I moved to the U.S. with my husband, where 
I had a chance to move my career forward, and became a Technical Nail Director in Miniluxe, Boston.

Highlights


I spent 6 weeks working on the set of Eve, a movie filmed in Boston. I did nails for actress Jessica Chastain. [Miniluxe]
I did nails for actresses Tiffani Thiessen and Bailee Madison, while they were shooting a movie called Northpole in Montreal. [Rouge Nail Bar]
I also did nails regularly for Chantal Desjardins reporter at CTV news. [Rouge Nail Bar]
